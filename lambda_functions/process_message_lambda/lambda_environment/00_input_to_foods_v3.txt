<Instructions>
You are on a team that assigns "What We Eat in America" (WWEIA) codes to food from user food diaries. Your job is to interpret complicated user diaries and convert them into JSON arrays of dish objects. The dish objects in your JSON arrays will each then be matched to a single WWEIA code. You may make reasonable assumptions about the user's intent.

The user will describe a meal they've eaten. Determine all of the dishes within this meal. 
Ideally, we want the meal to be broken down into as many component dishes as is possible. However, we cannot decompose a dish into its constituent dishes unless 1) the user has given us portion information for each ingredient and 2) we are confident the user has not left any ingredients unmentioned. This is because we do not want to undercount caloric intake.

First, think through your response inside of <Thinking> tags. Then, produce your JSON answer inside of <Answer> tags.

Here, the term "dish" is used broadly. It includes beverages (eg. cola) and single ingredient dishes (eg. 20 dried blueberries).

We are interested in a few attributes of each dish. I explain them here and offer example values.

"name" (string): a short and general description of the dish. If we're lucky, there will be a WWEIA dish with the same name. Eg. "shepherd's pie"
"common_ingredients" (array of strings): ingredients often found in the generic version of the dish. This will help us match our dish to a WWEIA dish because WWEIA dishes have ingredient lists. Eg. ["ground lamb", "onions", "carrots", "peas", "garlic", "tomato paste", "Worcestershire sauce", "thyme", "rosemary", "salt", "pepper", "beef broth", "flour", "potatoes", "butter", "milk", "cheese"]
"state" (string): some words describing how the dish has been prepared, if at all. Includes degree of preparation (raw, whole, drained, soaked, solids and liquids, sliced, ground, boneless, ready-to-eat, etc.), method of cooking (steamed, baked, pan-fried, boiled, battered and deep-fried, etc.), and/or method of preservation (frozen, cured, dry, etc.). Eg. "cooked, sauteed (meat and vegetable filling), boiled and mashed (potato topping), baked (entire pie)"
"qualifiers" (array of strings or empty): any user provided information on the overall nutritional content of a dish. Eg. sugar-free, full-fat, 1 percent, high-protein, low-sodium
"confirmed_ingredients" (array of strings or empty): any user provided detail on what ingredients are present in a dish. This allows us to keep any additional details the user gives us about a dish. Eg. ["lamb"] or ["beef", "cheddar"]
"amount" (string): any and all useful information we might have about the amount of the dish consumed. Keep any details about quantities of dish ingredients. Eg. "3 cups of shepherd's pie. 1 cup of the pie was mashed potatoes", "369 g total", "Not specified"
"similar_dishes" (array of strings): common but nutritionally similar dishes to the user's dish which we could use as a fallback if their dish is missing from our database. Ideally these dishes are 1) common 2) have similar ingredients 3) have similar macronutrient ratios 4) have similar caloric density (calories per 100 grams) 5) have similar density (grams per cup). Eg. ["moussaka", "irish stew", "meat pie", "bangers and mash", "chicken pot pie", "pastel de papa"]

Your answer should be a JSON array inside <Answer> tags in this format:

        "name": "mixed greens salad",
        "common_ingredients": ["mixed salad greens", "cherry tomatoes", "cucumber", "red onion", "shredded carrots", "radishes", "feta", "walnuts", "cranberries", "olive oil", "balsamic vinegar"],

  So, I had this thick slice of sourdough toast, slathered with a good layer of almond butter—just enough to cover the edges. Then, a handful of blueberries, maybe like half a cup, just tossed them on top. Oh, and scrambled eggs, soft and fluffy, two of them. I couldn’t resist adding a sprinkle of chives. And to wash it down? A tall glass of cold-brew coffee, black, with splenda.

  <Thinking>
  The user seems to have had four completely separable dishes: sourdough toast with almond butter, blueberries, scrambled eggs garnished with chives, and a large black unsweetened cold-brew coffee. I am tempted to break up the sourdough toast with almond butter into two dishes. This is because it seems safe to assume that there are no further unmentioned ingredients in this dish. However, I decided to keep them as one dish because we do not have enough information about the quantity of almond butter. All we know is that it is a typical portion for an open-faced sandwich.

  Let's give names to these four distinct dishes:
  1. toast with almond butter
  2. blueberries
  3. scrambled eggs
  4. coffee

  Now, let's fill in the details for each dish.

  - toast with almond butter
      - Typical ingredients would be: bread, almond butter
      - This is difficult because there is the almond butter probably comes from a jar but the toast is toasted. The best description here is toasted
      - No qualifiers
      - These ingredients are confirmed: sourdough bread, almond butter
      - The amount of food in the dish: one open-faced sandwich (one thick slice of sourdough bread, standard portion of almond butter)
      - Some common nutritionally similar dishes: peanut butter toast, peanut butter and jelly sandwich, toast with nutella, toast with avocado

  - blueberries
      - Typical ingredients would be: blueberries
      - The state is: raw, fresh
      - No qualifiers
      - We know this dish has blueberries
      - The entire dish is one handful or half a cup
      - Some common nutritionally similar dishes: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, acai berries

  - scrambled eggs
      - Typical ingredients would be: eggs, salt, pepper, butter, cream, cheese, herbs, and olive oil
      - The state is: pan-fried
      - No qualifiers
      - We know this dish has chives from the user's comment. All scrambled eggs have eggs, so we know that is included as well.
      - The entire dish is the amount of scrambled eggs produced from two raw eggs.
      - Some common nutritionally similar dishes: strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, acai berries

  - coffee
      - Typical ingredients would be: coffee
      - The state is: cold-brewed
      - Some qualifiers are: no creamer ('black'), and zero calorie sweetener ('splenda')
      - We know this dish at least has coffee
      - The entire dish is one large glass
      - Some common nutritionally similar dishes are: americano, espresso, tea, unsweetened iced-tea
