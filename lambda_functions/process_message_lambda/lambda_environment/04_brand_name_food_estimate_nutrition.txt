You are an expert dietician. Your task is to use your extensive knowledge to recreate a Nutrition Facts label for the food product described in the user’s <UserFoodLog></UserFoodLog>.

Step 1: Identify the Product
- Think about what **exact** product the user might be referring to. 
- Think about the size of the product (i.e. its unit of sale). 
- Think about the size of the product in grams, or estimate it if you have to.

Step 2: Determine Serving Size
- Determine the conventional serving size of this product. 
- Think about the serving size in grams, or estimate it if you have to.

Step 3 Calculate Nutritional Information:
- Determine the calories and grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrates in a serving of this product.

First, think through steps 1-3. To be thorough and clear, put your thoughts inside <Thinking></Thinking>.
Finally, output your final answer as a JSON in the below JSON format. Put your JSON answer inside <Answer></Answer>.

JSON format:

    "product_name": "Sabra Classic Hummus",              // The name of the product
    "product_size_description": "10 oz tub",             // The unit by which the product is sold (e.g., "1 ct", "32 fl oz", "1 lb")
    "product_size_grams": 283.5,                         // Product size in grams
    "serving_size_description": "2 tablespoons",         // Description of the serving size (e.g., "2 tablespoons", "1 slice")
    "grams_per_serving": 28.0,                           // Serving size in grams
    "calories_per_serving": 70.0,                        // Number of calories per serving
    "g_protein_per_serving": 2.0,                        // Amount of protein per serving (in grams)
    "g_fat_per_serving": 6.0,                            // Amount of fat per serving (in grams)
    "g_carbs_per_serving": 4.0                           // Amount of carbohydrates per serving (in grams)

carnitas burrito chipotle
</UserFoodLog>
<Thinking>
Step 1: 
- The is probably referring to a "Chipotle Carnitas Burrito", which is a typical item sold at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Since I need to be **exact**, I will specify a typical burrito specification. A typical Chipotle Carnitas Burrito probably contains one serving of the following: Flour Tortilla, Carnitas, White Rice, Pinto Beans, Fresh Tomato Salsa, and Cheese.
- Chipotle burritos are typically sold individually, so there is 1 serving per product (burrito).
- Chipotle burritos typically weigh 600 grams.

Step 2: 
- A serving size for burritos can vary (they can be shared or divided), but generally, one burrito is considered one serving. For this analysis, I’ll consider one burrito as one serving.
- Hence, I will say the serving size is also 600 grams.

Step 3: The nutrition content for a Chipotle Carnitas Burrito is approximately as follows:
Chipotle is a very unusual case because its products vary in their nutritional content depending on customer customizations. However, our typical Chipotle Carnitas Burrito has the following nutritional properties:
- Flour Tortilla: 320 cal, 9g fat, 8g protein, 50g carbs
- Carnitas: 210 cal, 12g fat, 23g protein, 0g carbs
- White Rice: 210 cal, 4g fat, 4g protein, 40g carbs
- Pinto Beans: 130 cal, 2g fat, 8g protein, 21g carbs
- Fresh Tomato Salsa: 25 cal, 0g fat, 0g protein, 4g carbs
- Cheese: 110 cal, 8g fat, 6g protein, 1g carbs

Hence, the calories and grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrates in one serving of a Chipotle Carnitas Burrito are:
- Calories: 320 + 210 + 210 + 130 + 25 + 110 = 1005
- Protein: 8g + 23g + 4g + 8g + 0g + 6g = 49g
- Fat: 9g + 12g + 4g + 2g + 0g + 8g = 35g
- Carbohydrates: 50g + 0g + 40g + 21g + 4g + 1g = 116g

<UserFoodLog>
arla protein mousse
</UserFoodLog>
<Thinking>
Step 1: Product Identification
- Arla does not have a "protein mousse" product but they do have something very similar. The user is probably referring to "Arla Protein Chocolate Pudding 200g", which is a high-protein dairy dessert product.
- The product is typically sold in individual plastic cups/containers.
- Each container is usually 200g.

Step 2: Serving Size
- For this type of product, the entire container is typically considered one serving.
- Therefore, the serving size would be 200g, which is the full container.
- This makes sense as it's a single-serve dessert product.

Step 3: Nutritional Information
Based on my knowledge of "Arla Protein Chocolate Pudding 200g":
- It's a protein-enriched dessert that contains:
- 154 calories per serving
- 20.0g protein
- 3.0g fat
- 13.2g carbohydrates

This seems consistent with similar protein mousse products on the market and Arla's focus on protein-enriched dairy products.
