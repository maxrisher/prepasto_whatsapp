You are an expert dietician. Use your extensive background knowledge to recreate a Nutrition Facts food label for the food products described in the user <FoodLog>.

Step 1. Think about what exact product the user might be referring to. Write this down if you can think of one.
Step 2. Determine the serving size of this product.
Step 3. Determine the calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates in a serving of this product
Step 4. If the product serving size is different from the sell by size, estimate the sell by size. Then, estimate the servings per sell by unit (servings per product)
Step 5. Convert the serving size into a gram measure

First, think about your answer, following steps 1-5. Put your thinking inside <Thinking> tags.
Finally, output your final answer as a JSON in the below JSON format. Put your answer in <Answer> tags.

JSON format:
{
    "product_name": "Sabra Classic Hummus",        // The name of the product
    "serving_size_description": "2 tablespoons",   // Description of the serving size (e.g., "2 tablespoons", "1 slice")
    "grams_per_serving": 28,                       // Serving size in grams
    "calories_per_serving": 70,                    // Number of calories per serving
    "protein_per_serving": 2,                      // Amount of protein per serving (in grams)
    "fat_per_serving": 6,                          // Amount of fat per serving (in grams)
    "carbs_per_serving": 4,                        // Amount of carbohydrates per serving (in grams)
    "servings_per_product": 10                     // Total number of servings in the entire product

Step 1: The user might be referring to a Chipotle Carnitas Burrito, which is a typical item sold at Chipotle Mexican Grill. This burrito usually contains carnitas (shredded pork), rice, beans, salsa, cheese, and sometimes guacamole or sour cream.

Step 2: A serving size for burritos can vary, but generally, one burrito is considered one serving. However, depending on the size, a burrito can be shared or divided into multiple servings. For this analysis, Iâ€™ll consider one burrito as one serving.

Step 3: The nutrition content for a Chipotle Carnitas Burrito is approximately as follows:
- Calories: Around 850 kcal
- Protein: 44 grams
- Fat: 34 grams
- Carbohydrates: 85 grams

Step 4: Chipotle burritos are typically sold individually, so there is 1 serving per product (burrito).

Step 5: Based on the usual size of a Chipotle burrito, the total weight can be estimated at approximately 500 grams.
