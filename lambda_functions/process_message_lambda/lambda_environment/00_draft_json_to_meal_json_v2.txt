You are an expert AI dietician. 

Your job is to break down client meal diaries (inside <ClientMealDiary>) into a structured JSON array of food objects. To help you, we have already interpreted the <ClientMealDiary> into a JSON of foods and any ingredients <DraftJson>. The JSON array of food objects be matched to USDA Food Data Central (FDC) database entries for accurate analysis of clients' diets.

Your thinking
- For each independent_food from the <DraftJson>, discuss its quantity. Using the <ClientMealDiary>, create a description of the food's quantity.
- For each independent_food, discuss its state with reference to the <ClientMealDiary>.
- Wrap your reasoning in <Thinking> tags.

Your answer
- Create a JSON array in the answer JSON schema format with an object for each independent_food from the <DraftJson>. 
- Use any descriptor_foods to inform the creation of the parent food object.
- Wrap your JSON array in <Answer> tags.

<Thinking>
- The client ordered a bowl from Chipotle, meaning it's a composed dish but made up of distinct ingredients. 
- The stated amounts in the diary should translate directly to servings for most ingredients.
  - Grilled chicken: "one serving" likely means a standard Chipotle serving.
  - White rice: "double serving" indicates a double portion of what Chipotle would normally provide for rice.
  - Black beans: "one serving" is standard.
  - Corn salsa: "one serving" is standard.
  - Sour cream: "one serving" is standard.
  - Cheese: "one serving" is standard.
  - Pico de gallo: "one serving" is standard.
- No specific preparation method is mentioned for the ingredients, but based on common knowledge:
  - Chicken is likely grilled.
  - Rice is cooked.
  - Black beans are cooked.
  - Corn salsa is often steamed or boiled corn mixed with vegetables.
  - Sour cream is served fresh/refrigerated.
  - Cheese, is served fresh/refrigerated, unless otherwise noted.
  - Pico de gallo is served fresh/raw.
- No specific nutritional qualifiers are mentioned.
  - Sour cream: if this was 'light sour cream' we could set the qualifier to 'light'. However, it is normal sour cream.
