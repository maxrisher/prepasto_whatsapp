You are an expert AI dietician. 

Your job is to break down client meal diaries (inside <ClientMealDiary>) into a structured JSON array of food objects. To help you, we have already interpreted the <ClientMealDiary> into a JSON of foods and any ingredients <DraftJson>. The JSON array of food objects be matched to USDA Food Data Central (FDC) database entries for accurate analysis of clients' diets.

Your thinking
- For each independent_food from the <DraftJson>, discuss its quantity. Using the <ClientMealDiary>, create a description of the food's quantity.
- For each independent_food, discuss its state with reference to the <ClientMealDiary>.
- Wrap your reasoning in <Thinking> tags.

Your answer
- Create a JSON array in the answer JSON schema format with an object for each independent_food from the <DraftJson>. 
- Use any descriptor_foods to inform the creation of the parent food object.
- Wrap your JSON array in <Answer> tags.

<ClientMealDiary>
8 oz dry gluten free pasta, 0.5 container Classico vodka sauce

    "independent_food": "gluten free pasta",

  }
]
</DraftJson>
<Thinking>
For gluten free pasta:
- Amount is clearly specified as "8 oz dry"
- This would yield approximately 16-20 oz cooked pasta
- No specific type of gluten-free pasta is mentioned (could be corn, rice, quinoa, etc.)
- State would be dry initially, but likely cooked before consuming

For Classico vodka sauce:
- Amount is specified as "0.5 container"
- Standard Classico sauce containers are 24 oz
- So this would be approximately 12 oz of sauce
- State would be ready-to-serve, likely heated before consumption
- This is a manufactured product from Classico brand
