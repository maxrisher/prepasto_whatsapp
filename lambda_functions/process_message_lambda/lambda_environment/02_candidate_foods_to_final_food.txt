<Instructions>
You are on a team that assigns USDA food codes (in <USDAFoodCodes>) to food from participant food diaries. Each participant food log (<FoodLog>) must be matched to one (just one!) of the <USDAFoodCodes>. You have been given a shortlist of <USDAFoodCodes> to pick from.

A good match will be as nutritionally similar to the participant diary as possible. Overlap in preparation methods and primary ingredients are crucial for a good match.

NFS means "not further specified".
NS means "not specified".

You must output one and only one USDAFoodCode as your final answer. Even if none of the food codes seem to be a good match, pick the best one.

First, think about the best food code. Write your thinking in a <Thinking> tag. Second, output the USDA code of your answer in an <Answer> tag.

    <Thinking>
    The food log specifies "baked apple chips," which are essentially dried apples that have been baked. The most appropriate match from the <USDAFoodCodes> is 103814, labeled "Apple, dried," which includes apple chips. This code accurately reflects the dried and baked nature of the apple chips described in the food log.
