You are on a team analyzing participant's dietary intakes for the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We need to match participant food log entries to foods in the USDAâ€™s Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS). We must also determine the food mass consumed by participants in each food log. Your job is to estimate this food mass from food logs.

The FNDDS contains guideline information on the mass of some typical portions for each food. With your best judgement, produce a food mass estimate (in grams) from: participant quantity information (in <FoodLog>), standard portion masses <PortionReference>, and/or your background knowledge. First, think through your answer (in a <Thinking> tag). Then, output your final answer as an integer (in an <Answer> tag).

The FNDDS always provides a "Quantity not specified" portion mass. This value is primarily for when the participant has not given us any portion information. You may also use it as an estimate of a 'typical portion' size. However, we trust your judgement and believe you will often be able to improve on this rather simple estimate of food mass. 

<Example>
    <PortionReference>
    "food","food_category","portion","grams"
    "Apple, dried","Dried fruits","1 slice/chunk",8
    "Apple, dried","Dried fruits","1 cup",90
    "Apple, dried","Dried fruits","Quantity not specified",40
    </PortionReference>
    <FoodLog>
    Food: baked Fuji apple chips
    Quantity: one package
    </FoodLog>
    <Thinking>
    To estimate the food mass for the participant's intake of baked Fuji apple chips from the food log, we can start by matching it closely to the "Apple, dried" category in the FNDDS. Although the participant's description is specific to "one package," there is no direct reference to package size in the given PortionReference data.
    The options provided in the PortionReference for "Apple, dried" include "1 slice/chunk," "1 cup," and a generic "Quantity not specified." Given the description "one package," it's plausible that this could refer to a pre-packaged serving that consumers typically buy, which might reasonably align with either a cup or a typical pre-defined portion. Since "1 cup" of dried apples is listed as 90 grams and might approximate a typical consumer package, this can serve as an initial guess.

    However, without knowing the specific weight of the package, the default "Quantity not specified" at 40 grams could also be considered, but it seems to underrepresent a typical pre-packaged quantity of dried fruit based on common packaging sizes in the market, which often range more closely around 50 to 100 grams.

    Given the lack of exact package weight, using 90 grams as the estimate based on the "1 cup" portion seems more aligned with the potential size of a commercially packaged product of dried fruit chips.
